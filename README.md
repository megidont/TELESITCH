# TELESITCH
A Quake 1 mod heavily inspired by the hit roguelike TELEGLITCH. The name will change soon.

## Why?
Because I like Quake and I like roguelikes and I wanted to cut my teeth on an actual Project project. Plus I wanna see if I can.

## Setup
Currently you download the qc and build it yourself. Tough luck kiddo. Wait for releases if you want the progs.dat.

I recommend the following build command:
```
fteqcc -Wno-mundane -O3
```
